Stack overflows have notoriously plagued the development processes.  They often can go undetected, and can present themselves in obscure ways.  Software mechanisms have been implemented to protect against them, but these have limitations and still don't protect against all conditions.  

With the maturity of the ARM architecture, wouldn't it be better to a 'fool-proof' mechanism for detecting overflows?

<!-- excerpt start -->

In this post, we will explore using the MSP Limit and the PSP Limit Registers on the ARM Cortex-M33 architecture to detect stack overflows.

We will walk through the implementation on the Renesas DA1469x and an look at practical examples of detecting stack overlows.

## Basic Terminology

The ARM Cortex-M33 introduced two new stack limit registers, PSPLIM and MSPLIM [^m33-psplim_msplim].

ARM has included this in it's ARMv8 specification, so any processors before this, will not have support.

## How does it work?
The best part about this new feature, is how easy it is to use, and how it takes the guess work out of stack overflow.  

The PSPLIM and the MSPLIM registers, just need to be set to the boundary of the stack.  If the MSP == MSPLIM register or the PSP == PSPLIM register, a UsageFault is created.  The UsageFault Status Register [^m33-usfr] contains a sticky bit in position four to indicate that a stack overflow occurred.  

With the PSP and MSP protection available, this allows us flexibility within an OS.  We can protect the MSP for exceptions and interrupts.  We can also switch out the PSPLIM value on a context switch to protect each task's stack.  If you need a refresher on context switching, check a previous post [here](2019-10-30-cortex-m-rtos-context-switching.md).

## Implementing the Limit Registers

For an implementation example on the DA1469x, you can access an example at Renesas's Github [^ARMV8_Guards].

### Initializing the MSPLIM Register

Writing to these registers, we use the MSR instruction which requires us to be in privileged mode.  In this case, we will set the MSP Limit in the Reset_Handler:

```c
Reset_Handler:

        ldr		r0, =__StackLimit
        add		r0, r0, #dg_configMSP_PADDING
        msr		MSPLIM, r0
```

Specifically to the DA1469x, we also need to place the same initialization in the Wakeup_Reset_Handler:

```c
Wakeup_Reset_Handler:

    ldr		r0, =__StackLimit
    add		r0, r0, #dg_configMSP_PADDING
    msr		MSPLIM, r0

```
The DA1469x sleep architecture, and doesn't pertain to all Cortex-M33 architectures.  The DA1469x replaces the Reset_Handler with this new handler, after initialization, to handle restoration of non-retained Cortex-M33 registers.  This includes the MSPLIM register, so we should restore it here.  

There's two definitions here that are provided elsewhere in the project.   __StackLimit is defined in vector_table_da1469x.S:

```c
.section .stack
                .align	3
                .globl	__StackTop
                .globl	__StackLimit
__StackLimit:
                .space	Stack_Size
                .size	__StackLimit, . - __StackLimit
__StackTop:
                .size	__StackTop, . - __StackTop
```
This helps us find the stack limit for setting the MSP.

We also add a little bit of padding to this value.  The padding is specified in a configuration file:

```c
#define dg_configMSP_PADDING                    (16)
```

When the MSPLIM is equal to the MSP, the UsageFault exception is triggered.   We want to make space on the stack, in case, the fault handler also needs to push items to the stack. If room isn't made for the fault handler, nested exceptions can occur, as the MSPLIM register continously becomes exceeded.  

The alternative would be to use a naked function[^gcc_attributes].  My preference, is to add padding as it provides more flexibility in the fault handler and allows for Memfault hooks!
 

### Initializing the PSPLIM Register

On the DA1469x SDK, it makes use of FreeRTOS.  So we can setup PSPLIM register to protect against tasks overflowing.  This is superior to FreeRTOS's stack overflow check[^1] for the following reasons:

1. FreeRTOS only checks the watermark on a context switch. This means if a thread overflows the stack, and isn't yielding, it can corrupt memory, access null pointers, etc. 

2. FreeRTOS does not recommend using this feature in production environments because of the context switch overhead[^2].

Implementing this is a little more straightforward.  We just need to adjust the PSPLIM during a context switch in FreeRTOS.

First we create the function to switchout the values.  In tasks.c we create the following above vTaskSwitchContext:

```c
void vTaskSwitchStackGuard(void)
{
        volatile uint32_t end_of_stack_val = (uint32_t)(uint32_t)pxCurrentTCB->pxStack;
     __set_PSPLIM( end_of_stack_val);
}
```

Next, we just add the call immediately after the context switch:

```c
void xPortPendSVHandler( void ){

...

"	bl vTaskSwitchContext				\n"
"   bl vTaskSwitchStackGuard                        \n"

...
}
```

That's all we need to do for the PSP.  

### Setting up the UsageFault_Handler

All that's left is doing a little bit of work in the UsageFault_Handler.  We're going to declare the UsageFault_Handler in exceptions_handler.s and call a seperate handler afterward.  

Declare an application handler:

```c
__RETAINED_CODE void UsageFault_HandlerC(uint8_t stack_pointer_mask)
{

    volatile uint16_t usage_fault_status_reg __UNUSED;

    usage_fault_status_reg = (SCB->CFSR &         SCB_CFSR_USGFAULTSR_Msk) >> SCB_CFSR_USGFAULTSR_Pos;

    hw_watchdog_freeze(); 

    if(usage_fault_status_reg & (SCB_CFSR_STKOF_Msk >> SCB_CFSR_USGFAULTSR_Pos))
    {
        
        while(1){}
    }

        while (1) {}
}

```

Next, let's add our UsageFault_Handler into the exceptions_handler.S:

```c
#if (dg_configCODE_LOCATION == NON_VOLATILE_IS_FLASH)
            .section text_retained
#endif
    .align  2
    .thumb
    .thumb_func
    .globl  UsageFault_Handler
    .type   UsageFault_Handler, %function
UsageFault_Handler:
    ldr		r2,=UsageFault_HandlerC
    mrs		r1, msp
    mrs		r0, MSPLIM
    cmp		r0, r1
    beq		UsageFault_with_MSP_Overflow
    mrs		r1, psp
    mrs		r0, PSPLIM
    cmp		r0, r1
    beq 	UsageFault_with_PSP_Overflow
    mov		r0, #0
    bx		r2
UsageFault_with_PSP_Overflow:
    mov 	r0, #2
    bx		r2
UsageFault_with_MSP_Overflow:
    ldr 	r1, =__StackLimit
    msr		MSPLIM, r1
    mov		r0, #1
    bx		r2
```

Since the USFR does not indicate if the psp or the msp caused the fault, I decided to add a little bit detection in assembly. They indicate as following:

*0 - General UsageFault 
*1 - MSP Overflow
*2 - PSP Overflow (Task Overflow)

Also, the MSP needs some special handling to make some room on the stack. 

In this function, we are checking the msp and the psp registers against the limit registers.  In the case that the msp matches the msplim register, we restore the msplim to the __StackLimit (Removing the padding we originally placed here) and then call our application fault handler.

### Testing our Implementation

We just need a small piece of code to test the implementation.  In this case, there is a macro for causing an overflow for the MSP or the PSP:

```c
#define TOGGLE_MSP_OVERFLOW (0)     //0 Creates an application overflow in FreeRTOS task, 1 creates it on the MSP
```

When the button is pressed, depending on this macro setting, it calls a recursive function either in interrupt context, or in our task.

```c
static void test_overflow_func(void)
{
        test_overflow_func();
}

static void _wkup_key_cb(void)
{
    BaseType_t need_switch; 
    /* Clear the WKUP interrupt flag!!! */
    hw_wkup_reset_interrupt();

#if TOGGLE_MSP_OVERFLOW > 0
    test_overflow_func();
#endif
        
        
    xTaskNotifyFromISR(overFlow_handle, BUTTON_PRESS_NOTIF, eSetBits, &need_switch); 
    portEND_SWITCHING_ISR(need_switch);
}

...

void prvTestOverFlowTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    _wkup_init();

    overFlow_handle = xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle();

    for ( ;; ) {
        uint32_t notif;
        /*
        * Wait on any of the notification bits, then clear them all
        */
        xTaskNotifyWait(0, 0xFFFFFFFF, &notif, portMAX_DELAY);

        /* Notified from BLE manager? */
        if (notif & BUTTON_PRESS_NOTIF) {
                test_overflow_func();
        }
    }
}
```

We should see the UsageFault_HandlerC, get called in our application code. 

## Closing

This is a great new feature from ARM, and a much needed addition to the architecture.  We hope that you found this useful, and can implement this in your own application.  This should prevent a lot of development headaches and safegaurd your application in the field!
